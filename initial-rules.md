title: Initial set of rules
---

## 101

All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in
which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect
whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-119 (immutable)
and 201-220 (mutable).

## 102

Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable.
Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to
mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers,
and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

## 103

At any time, one player is the Speaker. The Speaker is responsible for updating
the list of active rules and proposals as necessary.

## 104

The Speaker for the first game shall be mwpuppire.

## 105

A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment
of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a
mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule
or vice versa.

(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are
mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or
repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or
repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is absolutely
immune to change.)

## 106

All rule-changes legally proposed shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and
only if they receive the required number of votes and quorum is achieved.

## 107

All proposed rule-changes shall be posted in the `#voting` channel before they
are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which
they were voted on.

## 108

No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the
vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No
rule-change may have retroactive application.

## 109

The Speaker shall give each proposed rule change a number for reference. The
numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change legally proposed shall
receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to
reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the number of the
proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the
entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend
or repeal the amendment.

## 110

Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if
and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall
not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

## 111

In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes
precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this
rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that
immutable rule.

## 112

If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive
of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is
an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable
value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the
proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The
proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and,
unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate
and vote.

## 113

The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving
_n_ points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of _n_ and the means of
earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play
cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or
repealed.

## 114

A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play
or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the
player to incur it, may be imposed.

## 115

There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule-changes
must never become completely impermissible.

## 116

Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as
permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their
own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible
solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

## 117

Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated,
with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a
rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

## 118

Members of this Discord server who are not bots are considered players. A player
may opt out at any time from being considered a player by making some
declaration to that effect, and likewise can opt in by the same method.

## 119

A bot may never be considered to be a player.

## 201

Players shall alternate in alphabetical order by username, taking one whole turn
apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be
omitted.

## 202

All players begin with zero points. Points may not be gained, lost, or moved
except as explicitly stated in the rules.

## 203

One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and
having it voted on, and (2) subtracting 291 from the ordinal number of the
proposal and multiplying the result by the fraction of favorable votes it
received, rounded to the nearest integer, and adding this to the player's score.

## 204

A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible
voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of
turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.

## 205

A quorum is considered to be half of all players. No vote on a rule-change is
considered valid or finalized until at least a quorum of players have
participated in it.

This means no turn is considered completed until a quorum of players have
participated in any required votes.

## 206

If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote
against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.

## 207

An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the
vote that adopted it.

## 208

When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10
points.

## 209

Each player always has exactly one vote.

## 210

Votes are made in the `#voting` channel, by making some declaration to the
effect of affirming or rejecting a proposal. Votes may not be cast by any other
means.

## 211

The winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points. When a player
wins in this way:

* that player becomes the Speaker,
* all players' scores are reset to 0,
* and a new game is begun. All rules and proposed rule changes retain the status
  they had at the end of the prior game.

## 212

At no time may there be more than 33 mutable rules.

## 213

If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more
immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal
number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it
defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule
(or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for
determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to
one another, then the numerical method again governs.

## 214

If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or
application of a rule, then a player may invoke Judgment by making a declaration
to that effect. Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by
the insistence of any player.

When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin their turn
without the consent of a majority of the other players.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other
players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled,
then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge
for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during their
own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the
game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to their own
legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may,
however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and
that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked.

## 215

When Judgment is invoked, one player is randomly selected to be the Judge. If
the Judge fails to deliver a judgment within this time, they are penalized 10
points and a new Judge is appointed.

## 216

All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in
effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at
issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game
before applying other standards.

## 217

A player's turn is considered to begin when either:

* the player takes their first legal action as part of their turn,
* or the Speaker declares their turn is next.

## 218

If a turn has not been completed within 72 hours, the Speaker may choose at any
time to end the turn. If it is unclear how to proceed to the next turn, the
Speaker may call for Judgment before the next player begins.

## 219

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality
of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best
reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the
first player unable to complete a turn is the winner, with no provision for
starting another game.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.

## 220

In addition to duties listed elsewhere in the rules, the Speaker has the
following duties:

* keeping an up-to-date list of players and their current scores, and making
  such list available to players.
* keeping an up-to-date list of the current rules, and making such list
  available to players.
* making random choices when needed by the rules.
* keeping track of turns, and (while turn order exists) declaring whose turn is
  next.
